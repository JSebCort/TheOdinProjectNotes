# Introduction to Git
## Knowledge Check
1. What kind of program is Git?
    * Git is a Distributed Version Control (DVC) system. It allows for version control of files, so that one may keep track of updates made to the file.
    * As a DVC, the database, that holds all the files and their versions, is stored locally so that every user can work on a file without having to be connected to a server.
    * Git does not store an unchanged file again everytime it is committed. Instead, through snapshots, it stores a reference to that snapshot and links to the previous indentical file that was already stored.
    * Git checksums everything before it is stored through a SHA-1 hash. This hash is calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git.
	There are three main states to Git:
	* Modified - You have changed the file but haven't committed it to the database.
	* Staged - You have marked the file to be committed.
	* Committed - You have safely stored the updated file to the database.
2. What are the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping?
    * Git allows for multiple changes to a file to be stored, while a text editor can only modify and store one file without version control.
3. Does Git work at a local or remote level?
    * Local.
4. Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?
    * Remote; changes must be committed, with Git, to GitHub.
5. Why is Git useful for an individual developer?
    * Git allows for version control. The developer can easily rollback to a previous version if an error occurs at the most current version.
6. Why are Git and GitHub useful for a team of developers?
    * By utilizing both Git and GitHub, a team of developers can work on multiple files separately and their personal changes would be combined.

## Notes
**Git Commands**
1. Commands related to a remote repository:
    * Clones the repository to the local computer.
	    * git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git *OR* git clone https://github.com/user-name/repository-name.git
    * Pushes the local repository to GitHub.
	    * git push origin main
2. Commands related to workflow:
    * Adds all unstaged files **in the current directory** to the staging area.
	    * git add .
    * Commits the staged item with a description of the changes.
	    * git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
3. Commands related to checking status or log history
    * Shows the status of the repository's file.
	    * git status
    * Shows the history log of the changes made to the repository.
	    * git log
4. The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.
    * For example:
        * git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
        * git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
        * git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
